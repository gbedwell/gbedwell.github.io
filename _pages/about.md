I am a protein chemist turned computational biologist and general data enthusiast. 

I received my Ph.D. in Biophysics from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. During my Ph.D., I studied various aspects of virus and nanoparticle assembly using an assortment of biophysical techniques. The data analysis routines common to these techniques sparked my interest in data analysis methods, statistics, and computational science in general. Since then, I've spent a tremendous amount of effort growing my knowledge and abilities related to computational biology, computer programming, data analysis, data visualization, and statistics.

When I moved to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Medical School for a post-doctoral fellowship, I was still officially a protein chemist. In this regard, I have had success in various projects related to the expression and characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins and proteins that undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. All the while, however, my interests in computational and statistical methods have continued to grow. I have actively pursued these interests from both theoretical and applied perspectives in order to utilize these skillsets in new, exciting, and (hopefully) useful ways. I am currently working on several independent computational/statistical projects related to genomics, sports analytics, protein chemistry, and more. 

Outside of work, I happily spend the majority of my time with my wife and kids. We enjoy fantastical stories, good food, silly jokes, and many other things. I enjoy cooking, optimizing my espresso extraction, watching and discussing sports (especially soccer), and reading. I am also an avid fan of music and am finally beginning to appreciate podcasts (or at least a few of them).
