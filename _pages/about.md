I am a protein chemist, computational biologist, and general data enthusiast. 

I received my Ph.D. in Biophysics from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. During my Ph.D., I studied various aspects of virus and nanoparticle assembly using an assortment of biophysical techniques, particularly hydrodynamic and other solution-based techniques. This work helped establish my long-standing scientific interests in protein dynamics, protein design, and synthetic biology/bioinspired systems. The data analysis routines common to these biophysical techniques additionally sparked my interests in more complex data analysis techniques and statistical methodologies. Since graduate school, I've spent a tremendous amount of time growing my knowledge and abilities in these and related subjects (e.g. computational biology, computer programming, and data visualization).

At the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Medical School, I work as both a protein chemist and computational biologist. I have had success in a variety of protein-related projects involving the expression, purification, and characterization of compositionally unique human proteins. My interests in computational and statistical methods, meanwhile, have continued to grow. I have actively pursued these interests from both theoretical and applied perspectives in order to better utilize these skillsets in new, exciting, and useful ways. I am currently working on several computational/statistical projects related to genomics, protein chemistry, and more.

Outside of work, I happily spend most of my time with my wife and kids. We enjoy fantastical stories, good food, silly jokes, and many other things. I enjoy cooking, optimizing my espresso extraction, watching and discussing sports (especially soccer), and reading. I am also an avid fan of music and am finally beginning to appreciate podcasts (or at least a few of them).
