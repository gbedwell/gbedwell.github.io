I am a computational biologist, bioinformatician, protein chemist, and general data enthusiast.

I received my Ph.D. in Biophysics from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. During my Ph.D., I studied various aspects of virus and nanoparticle assembly using an assortment of biophysical techniques, particularly hydrodynamic and other solution-based techniques. This work helped establish my long-standing scientific interests in protein dynamics, protein design, synthetic biology/bio-inspired systems, and systems biology. Perhaps more importantly, however, the data analysis routines common to these biophysical assays opened my eyes to the possibilities of applying statistical concepts and models to noisy and imperfect data. Since then, I have eagerly followed the white rabbit into the world of computational biology, bioinformatics, computer programming, applied statistics, and data analysis/visualization.

At the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Medical School I work as a computational biologist and bioinformatician broadly studying genomic integration. I have written multiple software packages for processing and analyzing biological data, as well as packages for more general data analysis. I am involved in numerous collaborative projects across Harvard Medical School, the National Institutes of Health, and other world-renowned research institutions. As a passionate scientist and general nerd, I try to continuously grow my computational, statistical, and analytical skillsets in order to better approach research questions in novel and impactful ways.

Outside of work, I happily spend most of my time with my wife and kids. We enjoy fantastical stories, good food, silly jokes, and many other things. I enjoy cooking, optimizing my espresso extraction, watching and discussing sports (often through the lens of analytics), trying to schedule D&D sessions with my friends (and occasionally succeeding -- huzzah!), and reading. I am an avid fan of music and am finally beginning to appreciate podcasts (or at least a few of them).
