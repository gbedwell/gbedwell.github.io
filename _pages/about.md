I am a computational biologist, bioinformatician, and protein chemist with a deep passion for data and discovery. Professionally, my expertise spans NGS data processing and analysis, protein structure prediction, and protein biophysics. I am adept at finding computational solutions to complex and important biological problems. Beyond my professional skills, I'm an avid learner with a wide variety of intellectual interests and a penchant for the occassional deep-dive.

I received my Ph.D. in Biophysics, during which I explored various aspects of virus and nanoparticle assembly using structural, biophysical, and computational approaches. This work not only established many of my enduring scientific interests, but also served as my introduction to the wonderful world of data analysis. I was amazed that the software associated with instruments like the labâ€™s mass spectrometer or analytical ultracentrifuge could transform noisy, imperfect data into meaningful insights. "How did that software infer a probability distribution from <i>that</i> data?!" It seemed like magic, and its potential seemed unbounded. I was compelled to learn more. So, I jumped in.

Since then, my interests in data analysis, computing, and statistics have continued to grow. That is to say, I'm still swimming. My trajectory hasn't necessarily been linear, but it could probably be described as monotonically increasing. I <i>really</i> like using computers to understand data and learn new things about them. I also <i>really</i> like learning new ways to do that. Every new method or algorithm that I learn is like another spell in my spellbook. I'm excited about casting those spells and better understanding the world around me.

Outside of work, I happily spend most of my time with my wife and kids. We enjoy fantastical stories, good food, silly jokes, and many other things. I enjoy cooking, watching and discussing sports (often through the lens of analytics), venturing into the Forgotten Realms with my friends (that's a D&D reference), and reading. I am an avid fan of music and am finally beginning to appreciate podcasts (or at least a few of them).
