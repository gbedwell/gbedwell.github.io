I am a protein chemist turned computational biologist and general data enthusiast. 

I received my Ph.D. in Biophysics from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. During my Ph.D., I studied various aspects of virus and nanoparticle assembly using an assortment of biophysical techniques. The data analysis routines common to these techniques sparked my interest in data analysis methods and computational science in general. I was amazed at what kind of information could be pulled out of (sometimes even very noisy) data!

When I moved to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Medical School for a post-doctoral fellowship, I was still focused primarily on protein chemistry. Over time, however, it became increasingly clear that I strongly favor programming and computational data analysis over wet bench science. As such, I have worked hard to grow my knowledge and abilities related to computational biology, computer programming, data analysis, data wrangling, and statistics.

I hope to use this website as a space where I can write about topics that interest me and to discuss my work in casual yet well-documented ways.

Outside of work, I happily spend the majority of my time with my wife and kids. We enjoy fantastical stories, good food, silly jokes, cute animals, and many other things. I enjoy cooking, watching soccer matches whenever I can (YNWA), and reading. I am also an avid fan of music and am finally beginning to appreciate podcasts (or at least a few of them).
