That is, whether or not a given feature (e.g. a particular gene) harbors more integration sites than would be expected given a true random distribution. In principle,...","categories": [],

The ability to account for overdispersion in observed data using the NB distribution has led to its application across a wide range scientific disciplines as an...","categories": [],
